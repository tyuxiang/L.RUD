* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing

is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.
